# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for replacing Vercel Cron Jobs with GitHub Actions workflows in the Open-nof1.ai project. The system currently uses Vercel's cron functionality to execute automated trading metrics collection and AI trading decisions at regular intervals. This change aims to migrate the scheduling mechanism to GitHub Actions while maintaining all existing functionality and ensuring high reliability, testability, and maintainability.

## Glossary

- **GitHub Actions**: GitHub's CI/CD platform that allows automation of workflows
- **Vercel Cron Jobs**: Vercel's serverless cron job functionality
- **Metrics Collection**: Process of gathering trading account performance data every 20 seconds
- **Trading Execution**: AI-driven trading decision process that runs every 3 minutes
- **Cron Endpoints**: API endpoints that handle scheduled tasks (/api/cron/*)
- **CRON_SECRET_KEY**: Authentication token used to secure cron job endpoints
- **Workflow**: A GitHub Actions automated process defined in YAML
- **Schedule Trigger**: GitHub Actions cron syntax for timing workflow execution

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to migrate from Vercel Cron Jobs to GitHub Actions workflows, so that I have better control over scheduling and can leverage GitHub's infrastructure for automation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the GitHub Actions workflow is triggered by schedule, THE GitHub_Actions_System SHALL call the metrics collection endpoint every minute
2. WHEN the GitHub Actions workflow is triggered by schedule, THE GitHub_Actions_System SHALL call the trading execution endpoint every 3 minutes
3. WHEN making HTTP requests to cron endpoints, THE GitHub_Actions_System SHALL include the CRON_SECRET_KEY for authentication
4. WHERE the existing Vercel cron configuration exists, THE GitHub_Actions_System SHALL replace it completely without affecting other functionality
5. WHILE maintaining backward compatibility, THE GitHub_Actions_System SHALL ensure all existing API endpoints continue to work unchanged

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive test coverage for the new GitHub Actions implementation, so that I can ensure 100% reliability and maintainability of the cron job replacement.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Testing_Framework SHALL achieve 100% code coverage for all new GitHub Actions related code
2. WHEN testing workflow files, THE Testing_Framework SHALL validate YAML syntax and structure
3. WHEN testing cron endpoint calls, THE Testing_Framework SHALL mock HTTP requests and verify correct parameters
4. THE Testing_Framework SHALL include unit tests for all utility functions and helper methods
5. THE Testing_Framework SHALL include integration tests that verify end-to-end workflow execution

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want the GitHub Actions implementation to follow KISS principles and maintain high cohesion with low coupling, so that the system remains simple to understand and maintain.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE GitHub_Actions_Implementation SHALL use minimal dependencies and simple workflow structures
2. WHEN creating workflow files, THE GitHub_Actions_Implementation SHALL separate concerns between metrics collection and trading execution
3. THE GitHub_Actions_Implementation SHALL maintain loose coupling with existing API endpoints
4. WHERE configuration is needed, THE GitHub_Actions_Implementation SHALL use environment variables and secrets management
5. THE GitHub_Actions_Implementation SHALL include clear documentation and comments for all workflow steps

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want to ensure zero downtime and no functional impact during the migration, so that trading operations continue uninterrupted.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the migration is complete, THE System SHALL maintain identical scheduling intervals (1 minute for metrics, 3 minutes for trading)
2. THE Migration_Process SHALL not modify any existing API endpoint functionality
3. WHEN GitHub Actions workflows execute, THE System SHALL produce identical results to the previous Vercel cron implementation
4. THE Migration_Process SHALL include rollback procedures in case of issues
5. WHILE removing Vercel cron configuration, THE Migration_Process SHALL preserve all other Vercel deployment settings

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a security-conscious operator, I want the GitHub Actions implementation to maintain the same security standards as the current Vercel cron setup, so that the system remains protected against unauthorized access.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN GitHub Actions workflows make API calls, THE Security_System SHALL authenticate using the CRON_SECRET_KEY
2. THE GitHub_Actions_Implementation SHALL store sensitive credentials in GitHub Secrets
3. WHEN workflow execution fails, THE Security_System SHALL not expose sensitive information in logs
4. THE GitHub_Actions_Implementation SHALL include rate limiting and error handling mechanisms
5. WHERE possible, THE Security_System SHALL implement additional security measures like IP restrictions or request signing

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a monitoring specialist, I want comprehensive logging and error handling in the GitHub Actions workflows, so that I can troubleshoot issues and monitor system health effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN workflows execute successfully, THE Logging_System SHALL record execution timestamps and results
2. IF workflow execution fails, THEN THE Error_Handling_System SHALL log detailed error information and attempt retry logic
3. THE Monitoring_System SHALL provide visibility into workflow execution history and success rates
4. WHEN API endpoints return errors, THE Error_Handling_System SHALL implement appropriate retry strategies with exponential backoff
5. THE Logging_System SHALL maintain structured logs that can be easily parsed and analyzed
